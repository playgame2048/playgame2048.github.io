    <h2>📝 How to Play Flappy Bird</h2>
    <p>
      In Flappy Bird, your goal is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes without hitting them. 
      Tap the spacebar (or click/tap on mobile) to make the bird flap and stay in the air.
    </p>

    <h3>🎯 How to Score</h3>
    <p>
      Every time you pass through a set of pipes, you earn 1 point. 
      Try to beat your high score by staying calm and timing your flaps carefully.
    </p>

    <h3>💡 Tips to Win</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't spam the flap button; time your jumps carefully.</li>
      <li>Keep your bird near the center of the screen for more control.</li>
      <li>Focus on the gaps between pipes instead of the obstacles themselves.</li>
    </ul>
